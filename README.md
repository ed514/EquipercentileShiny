This Shiny application is intended to illustrate the mechanics of equipercentile linking as used for the MSAS.  The algorithm used in production is not the same as the one used in this application, but they both behave similarly and serve the same purpose (e.g., to mirror the distribution of schools w/science as closely as possible).  Feel free to adjust the sliders, view the graphs, check out the tables, and/or download the simulated data.
